# Onion Skinning

With [onion skinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning)
you can see several frames at once in the [sprite editor](sprite-editor.md).
In this way you can use other frames as reference to draw the current one.
You can activate the onion skinning using <kbd>F3</kbd> key or with the little
![onion skinning](animation/onion-skinning.png) icon in the timeline:

![Enable onion skinning](animation/enable-onion-skinning.gif)

You can specify how many previous and next frames do you want to see
and configure other settings from the
![Configure Timeline](animation/configure-timeline.png) icon (like red/blue tint):

![Change onion skinning settings](animation/onion-skinning-settings.gif)
