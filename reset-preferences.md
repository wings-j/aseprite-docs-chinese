# Reset Preferences

Aseprite preferences are stored in a `aseprite.ini` file in the
[configuration folder](preferences-folder.md). You can access this folder from _Edit >
Preferences > Locate Configuration File_. To reset all configuration
you can close Aseprite and delete all the files where `aseprite.ini` is located:
